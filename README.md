When you first come in the website, you will obviously see all the animes that are display. 
If you click on one, everything will disappear and more informations on the anime you clicked and quotes from the same anime will appear instead.

In case you don't find the anime you want in the 25 that are on the page you can click on the two buttons on the left and right of the page. 
The button on the right will display you the next group of 25 animes.
The one on the left will allow you to go back on the previous group.

On top of the website, you will see a scrolling menu wich allow you to choose a genre of anime if you want to narrow your results and don't want to go through every pages.
There is also on the top right side a button to go back to the fist page if you want.
